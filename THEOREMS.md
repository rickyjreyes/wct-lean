# WCT Lean Theorem Inventory

This file lists maintained `WCTLean` declarations and separates kernel proofs from definitions, contracts, counterexamples, and unresolved work.

Nothing in this inventory proves WCT as a complete physical theory.

## Dimension, curvature, energy, Koide, and Fourier foundations

Maintained foundational declarations include:

```lean
hbar_div_c_mul_k_is_mass
weighted_average_preserves_dimension
kappa_sq_dim
tau_sq_dim
sqrt_inverse_length_squared
sqrt_kappa_sq_dim
square_nonnegative
positive_quadratic_energy_nonnegative
koide_denominator_positive
koide_well_defined
koide_positive
two_cos_mul_cos
```

`cos_orthogonality_TODO` is a proposition definition, not a proof.

## Koide derivation module

`WCTLean/Models/KoideDerivation.lean` proves:

```lean
spinKoide_identity
spinKoide_half
geometricKoide_of_curvature_harmonic
```

These are algebraic consequences of the encoded definitions. They do not derive the physical identification of spin with the Koide mass angle.

## Remaining analytical boundary

Not closed by the current theorem set:

- exact variation of the full WCT action;
- function spaces, admissible domains, and boundary conditions;
- local/global well-posedness of the full nonlinear PDE;
- existence, localization, finite energy, decay, and continuum-limit survival;
- linearized spectral and orbital stability;
- `ε → 0` quotient control;
- complete Fourier integral orthogonality;
- curve-integral locking on manifolds;
- theorem-level derivation of particle masses, forces, gauge fields, gravity, cosmology, or experimental claims.
